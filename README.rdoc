This is the finance tracker app from the Complete Ruby on Rails Developer course!
This was created during my independent studies of Ruby and the Rails framework. This web application is hosted on a Heroku server and has various features, such as:
-a login/logout system, authentication, and view templates generated by using the Devise gem(https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
-ability to search stocks utilizing the 'stock_quote'â€‹ gem file (https://github.com/tyrauber/stock_quote), and save the quotes to your profile to keep track of up to 10 stocks. RESTful application via JSON.
-a friend system managed via integration of several models, using Postgres database system in Heroku.

A demo of the app can be found on: https://money-track.herokuapp.com/
